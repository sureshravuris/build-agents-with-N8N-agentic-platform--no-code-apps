# N8N Agent Applications

Building intelligent automation workflows using N8N platform. This project demonstrates the implementation of three distinct agent-based applications focusing on different automation scenarios.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains three N8N workflow implementations showcasing various automation capabilities:

1. **Customer Support Chat Agent**
   - Interactive chat frontend
   - Automated response handling
   - Real-time user interaction

2. **Backend Event Processing Agent**
   - Automated email processing
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Background task automation

3. **Human-AI Hybrid Agent**
   - AI-first response system
   - Human fallback integration
   - Seamless handoff mechanism

## ⚙️ System Architecture

Each application is built using N8N's workflow automation platform:

```
